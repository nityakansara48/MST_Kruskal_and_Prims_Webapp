# MST_Kruskal_and_Prims_Webapp
This is a python based web application of implementation and comparison between two minimum spanning trees algorithms, Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithm is implemented using python programming language (Python 3.7.4). The project report is also included.  To run and execute the comparison between two minimum spanning trees algorithms, Run this python web application in your system with python version (>3.7.0). The web application will begin and give the graph vertices values with their weights separated by comma (,). For example, 1,2,6,3,2,5,2,1,8,.. In this graph, Vertices 1 and 2 connected with an edge of weight 6, Vertices 3 and 2 connected with an edge of weight 5 and Vertices 2 and 1 connected with an edge of weight 8. After clicking on submit button, The total number of vertices, matrix representation of graph, the cost of minimum spanning tree for both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm, the runtime for both algorithm and edges in minimum spanning tree will be displayed to user. An user can easily compare both algorithms for same inputs.
